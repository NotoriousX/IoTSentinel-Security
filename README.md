# IoTSentinel-Security
IoTSentinel is a network security tool with a modern CLI for scanning IoT devices, identifying open ports, and detecting vulnerabilities. The interface features a welcome banner, prompts for network scanning, detailed vulnerability information, and options to generate reports, visualize results, or rescan the network.

Features

Network Scanning: Identify all active IoT devices within a specified IP range and detect open ports.
Vulnerability Detection: Check for known vulnerabilities using the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
Detailed Reports: Generate HTML and CSV reports with detailed information about the devices, services, and vulnerabilities found.
Interactive Visualization: Visualize vulnerable devices on your network with detailed information about each vulnerability.
User-Friendly CLI: Simple and intuitive CLI with interactive prompts for easy use.

Installation

Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or later
pip for managing Python packages


Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/NotoriousX/IoTSentinel.git

cd IoTSentinel

python3 iot_sentinel.py


Usage

Once you run the script, you'll be greeted with a welcome banner and prompted to scan your network. After the scan, you'll have the option to generate reports, visualize vulnerabilities, or rescan the network.

Example Workflow
Start the Network Scan: Enter the IP range and ports to scan.

View Vulnerability Details: After the scan, any detected vulnerabilities are displayed with details.

Generate Reports: Choose to generate an HTML or CSV report for detailed documentation.

Visualize Vulnerabilities: Use the interactive visualization to see which devices are vulnerable and which services are affected.


Menu Options
Rescan the Network: Start a new scan if youâ€™ve added new devices or want to refresh the data.
Generate HTML Report: Create a detailed HTML report that you can view in any web browser.
Generate CSV Report: Export the scan results to a CSV file for further analysis.
Visualize Vulnerabilities: Generate an interactive chart showing all vulnerable devices and their details.
Exit: Close the program.



Please scan the network first.
Enter the IP range to scan (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24): 192.168.1.0/24
Enter the ports to scan (e.g., 80, 22-80): 22,80
Scanning the network 192.168.1.0/24 for IoT devices on ports 22,80...

Checking for known vulnerabilities...

Vulnerabilities found:

Device: 192.168.1.10:80 (http)
  - CVE-2021-XXXXX: Some description of the vulnerability.
  - CVE-2021-YYYYY: Another vulnerability description.
